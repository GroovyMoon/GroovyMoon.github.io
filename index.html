I am a senior at <a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University </a> pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Human Computer Interaction, and a M.S. in Management Science and Engineering. I'm passionate about creating new technology and systems that help redefine the lives of people on a large scale. Even though computers have grown increasingly familiar to me over the years, they still continue to carry the same level of fascination for me as when I first began my explorations at the age of 10.
<br>
<br> I love working in collaborative environments. One of my favorite activities is attending hackathons, since that gives me a platform to work at the intersection of two of my passions - innovation and collaboration.
<br>
<br> I really enjoy teaching! Over the years, I have been a Section leader for <a href="https://cs106b.stanford.edu">CS106B: Programming Abstractions</a>, and I'm currently a TA for MS&E 278: Patent Law and <a href="https://cs131.stanford.edu">CS131: Computer Vision.</a>

<br> I worked as a backend engineer on the IMDb platform, on the Consumer Reference team. I created production-ready video ingestion service from scratch, which brought down the time to upload a video to the IMDb platform from several minutes to a few seconds.
<br> <br>
My first industry internship came with a lot of new experiences. From learning how to design software infrastructure to deploying code to beta for the first time, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Amazon.

<br> I worked on a project known as Facilitating Affect Regulation in children diagnosed with ASD, or FAR.
<br>
<br> I developed an end-to-end haptic breathing pacer for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Swift and Arduino. I built an iOS app from scratch to manage the device and implemented bluetooth communication protocols between the app and the microprocessor on the device.

<br> I am a section leader for CS106A and CS106B, Stanford's introductory CS sequence and largest undergraduate classes with typical enrollments of around 500 students per quarter.
<br>
<br> I teach a weekly discussion section to solidify concepts taught in lecture and work through programming problems. I hold office hours, where I am responsible for answering questions and helping students debug their code. I also held workshops and assisted new Section Leaders through practice teaches.

<br> Stanford was my dream school ever since I was 13. When I got here, it was everything I had imagined.
<br>
<br> The scale and diversity of opportunities at Stanford were unprecedented, and they pushed to expand my perspective and challenge myself to the fullest. From being a member of Applied cybersecurity to playing tournaments on the men's ultimate team, I was able to truly develop my interests and find neww ones outside class.
<br>
<br> Being in the presence of such remarkable peers and inspiring people, everyday at Stanford feels like a dream.

<br> At some point during the pandemic, scheduling utilities lost their appeal. Most were hard to use on phones, and thus I created WhatTimeWorks, a real-time organization application that helps you get availabilities and schedule events when a large number of people are involved.
